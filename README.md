# HDL-language

We've designed a digital calculator using VHDL, a special language for describing how digital circuits work. 
This calculator can handle four main operations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Think of it 
like a digital math machine with buttons. Each operation corresponds to a button: addition is like pressing one button, s
ubtraction is another, division is a third (but it won't divide by zero), and multiplication is the fourth. The calculator takes two sets 
of numbers, each with 8 switches that can be either on or off .
